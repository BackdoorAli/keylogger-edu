# 🧪 Case Study: Educational Keylogger Usage

## 🧠 Scenario

This keylogger was created as a red team simulation tool to:
- Understand how attackers collect sensitive data
- Simulate threats in a lab environment
- Train blue team detection and response skills

## 🔍 Key Features Tested

- Keystroke logging
- Clipboard monitoring
- System info logging
- Stealth execution
- Email exfiltration of log files

## ✅ Red Team Value

Shows how simple Python scripts can be used for stealthy data collection. Highlights how clipboard access, keystroke logging, and window monitoring can be combined with email exfiltration for real-world simulations.

## 🛡️ Next Steps

Pair with the [Keylogger Defender](https://github.com/Mira2720/keylogger-defender-advanced) to simulate detection and mitigation.
